# Presentation Prep

1. Test your presentation:
 * As your team finishes up your MVP and begins to focus more on strech goals, 
  take a few minutes at some point to go into a classroom and take a look at 
  your app as it displays on a projector. 

2. Plan your presentation... have a script:
 * Who will give an intro, and tell us about the problem domain and your team's solution? 
 * Who will talk about the functionality, and walk us through the app?
 * Individually, speak for a maximum of 3 minutes on what portion of the project you worked on.

3. Rehearse your presentation:
 * Decide who's machine will present the app on the projector, test it, and then test a second computerâ€¦ just in case.
 * Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics. Know how much time each segment will take.

4. Overall presentation script:
 * Run some tests!
 * 5 minutes - Intro/demo
 * 3 minutes per person (12 minutes total, more or less)
 * Q&A
